## Installation

### Windows

A pre-compiled package is available at http://goo.gl/uLUL2l

Extract this package to a folder and run `eu4Replay.exe` in order to launch the program.  If this does not work, please file an issue; it is currently only tested on amd64 Windows 8.1.

Alternatively, you can install the dependencies shown in the OS X & Linux section, either from source or from binary distributions.  I have tested with the amd64 binaries from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

### OS X & Linux

Install Python 2.7 and the following dependencies using your favourite package manager (eg, brew on OS X).  Versions which have been tested are shown in brackets.

Dependencies:
* wxpython (2.8.12.1)
* numpy (1.7.1)
* scipy (0.11.0)
* matplotlib (1.2.1)
* PIL (1.1.7)

After that, all that is required should be to clone this repo and configure your settings file.

## Configuration

### Overview

Configuration takes place in `settings.cfg`.

You must save any changes prior to launching the program.  Configuration changes are not currently supported via the GUI.

### EU4 Directory

You will need to specify the full path to your EU4 directory.

Please note that if you are entering a windows path, you *must* escape any backslashes.  In other words, enter `C:\\Games`, **not** `C:\Games`.

There is currently no intelligent mod support.  However, as long as your mod overrides the following files, you may be able to set `eu4_directory` to your mod directory:
* `map/provinces.bmp`
* `map/definition.csv`
* `map/default.map`
* `common/country_tags/`
* `common/countries/`
* `history/provinces/`

Proper mod support will be added in a later version.

### Mod Support

If your save file was created using a mod, you will need to fill out the `mods` settings.

Set `mods_directory` to your mods directory.  If you are on windows, you can try leaving this empty; the program will try to determine it automatically.

Set `mod_name` to the name of your mod.  This should be the name of the mod file, without the extension (eg, for `vef.mod`, `"mod_name": "vef").

Both compressed and uncompressed mods are supported.  However, you will get much better performance with an uncompressed mod.

If your mod starts at a different date to vanilla EU4, you will need to alter `start_date` (and similarly with `end_date`).

### Start and End Dates

Enter `start_date` and `end_date` in `yyyy.mm.dd` format.

The program currently assumes that it will be able to determine the original owner of a province as at the start date (using the history files).

Unspecified behaviour may result if this is not possible.

### Month Names

You may localise month names using the `month_names` settings key.

Exactly 12 names are required, for obvious reasons.

### Animated GIFs

The `gif_settings` key contains several options which control how animated GIFs are generated:
* `tick_duration` is the time, in seconds, that a frame is displayed before the GIF changes
* `tick_years` is the time, in years, between frames

A GIF will be generated for all times between `start_date` and `end_date` (or as close as is possible given the value of `tick_years`.

## Usage

### Loading Province Data

The first thing you need to do is load the map data.  There are two ways to do this:

1. File -> Map -> Load Provinces File
  * this will load a previously-generated provinces file
2. File -> Map -> Build Provinces File
  * this will parse `provinces.bmp`, along with various other files, to determine the location of each province on the map
  * building a province file is a very slow process
  * you will be prompted for somewhere to save the file, so that you may re-use it in future
  * this should only be required if you are using a new map (eg, a mod)

A provinces file for the default map is available at http://goo.gl/XlwaMY

This file must be unzipped before use.

### Loading a Save File

Next, you need to load a save file, by choosing File -> Saves -> Load Save File.

Parsing the save file can take a few minutes.  Getting the province histories themselves is easy; the problem is dealing with tag changes, which requires parsing the entire file so that country histories can be accessed.

If this is an issue, I can look at further optimisation.

### Viewing History

Move the sliders to set the current date.

The map will update automatically, although it may take a few seconds if you're making big adjustments.  (This is because the history is advanced day-by-day.)

Previously viewed dates are cached to enable instant back-tracking.  If this causes memory issues, a configuration setting can be added to disable this behaviour.
